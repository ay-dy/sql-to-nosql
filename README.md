# SQL to NoSQL Conversion Tool (Front-End)

This Sql to NoSQL Conversion Tool React.js app code for the 2023 Project (6G6Z1101_2223_9Z6). I have used the MDN Web Docs deneral, as well JS-specific, code styling guidelines.

## Running The App

1. Extract the zip file on your local machine.
   
2. In the terminal, run the app with `npm run dev`.
   
3. While holding `CTRL`, click on the link provided by Vite to load the web page.

## Side Notes
Refer to the showcase video to grasp how each part of the app works. I have used dependencies such as styled-components to speed up the process of developing a good-looking front-end. Since the front-end was not the major focus throughout the development of the tool, the web app had to be up and running as soon as possible.
